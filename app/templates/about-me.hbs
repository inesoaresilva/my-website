  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Hey there 👋 I’m Inês and I’m based in Porto, Portugal 🇵🇹</p>

  <p>
    I lived in Coimbra (best city in the world to spend your university years, I
    can spend hours talking about all the cool traditions) for my bachelor
    degree in Informatic Engineering.

    Then, I moved to Porto to take my master degree in Biomedical Engineering,
    since the healthcare field always motivated me.
  </p>
  <p>
    My master’s thesis was about a telemedicine system that used sensors to
    track sleep. I did this work in the Albertov Research Center in Prague,
    where I lived for 6 months.

  <p>Doing this Erasmus program, unlocked my will for adventure and travelling.</p>
  <ul>
    Since then I lived in 2 more countries:
    <li>
      🇦🇹 Austria - where I did a backend internship in Adidas Runtastic.
    </li>
    <li>
      🇨🇻 Cape Verde - where I had my first experience in a digital nomad
      community.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Although I love traveling, I like the feeling of coming back 'home', and
    right now that place is Porto for me.
  </p>
  <p>
    Right now, I'm working as a software engineer at
    <a
      href='https://mainmatter.com/'
      rel='noopener noreferrer'
      target='_blank'
    >Mainmatter.</a>
   </p>
  <p>
    In this company I discovered the frontend world and I'm enjoying it a lot,
    I'm working mainly with React. However, I like to explore other frameworks
    and this is how this website was born using Ember 🐹

      I love finding nice cafes to stay working. This place is 'Ler Devagar' in Lisbon.

  <p>
    The other motivation for creating my place on the web comes from my
    enjoyment of documenting my experiences. I've had a blog before, back in
    2013 on Blogspot. Also, since I was a kid I would always keep diaries.
  </p>
  <p>This place will be for me to share some of my learning path in the world of
    tech as a software engineer and my travel journeys. 👩‍💻 🌍</p>

  <p> Welcome 🤗</p>
